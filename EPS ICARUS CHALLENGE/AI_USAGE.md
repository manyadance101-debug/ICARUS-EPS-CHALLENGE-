# AI Usage

This file documents how AI tools were used in this project.

## Tools used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) — used to:
  - Explain CircuitJS1 usage
  - Provide step-by-step build procedure
  - Helped in generating basic images for connection

## Prompts / workflow
- Prompts included questions such as: "What is CircuitJS? , How are the nodes represented? , How to label the nodes?, How to make the connections? , How to save the project and extract the code? , Explain how to simulate EPS for a Cubesat"
- Responses were reviewed and adapted; numeric answers checked manually (no blind copying).

## Human verification & critique
- All AI-suggested numeric values (resistors, timings) were verified by hand using P = V²/R and I = P/V relationships(attached the image in results).
-One major critique: Cant learn how to use a tool using AI only and AI keeps changing answer when asked the same question again(not reliable).

## Non-AI sources
- CircuitJS1 (Falstad) online simulator documentation.
- Course / challenge PDF (provided by instructor) — primary requirements.
